              1. Using Immutable Data Structures
            </span>
            <br />
            Data immutability is not an architecture or design pattern, it’s an
            opinionated way of writing code. This forces you to think about how
            you structure your application data flow. In my opinion, data
            immutability is a practice that revolves around a strict
            unidirectional data flow.

            </span>
            <br />
            In React, function components and PureComponent provide two
            different ways of optimizing React apps at the component level.
            Function components prevent constructing class instances while
            reducing the overall bundle size as it minifies better than classes.

            If you are using webpack 4 as a module bundler for your app, you can
            consider setting the mode option to production. This basically tells
            webpack to use the built-in optimization

            2 What are the different ways to manage a state in a React
            application?
          </h1>
          <ol className="text-2xl list-disc">
            <li>
              <span className="font-bold text-xl">Local (UI) state</span> –
              Local state is data we manage in one or another component. Local
              state is most often managed in React using the useState hook. For
              example, local state would be needed to show or hide a modal
              component or to track values for a form component, such as form
              submission, when the form is disabled and the values of a form’s
              inputs.
            </li>

            <li>
              <span className="font-bold text-xl">Global (UI) state</span> –
              Global state is data we manage across multiple components. Global
              state is necessary when we want to get and update data anywhere in
              our app, or in multiple components at least. A common example of
              global state is authenticated user state. If a user is logged into
              our app, it is necessary to get and change their data throughout
              our application. Sometimes state we think should be local might
              become global.
            </li>

            <li>
              <span className="font-bold text-xl">Server state</span> – Data
              that comes from an external server that must be integrated with
              our UI state. Server state is a simple concept, but can be hard to
              manage alongside all of our local and global UI state. There are
              several pieces of state that must be managed every time you fetch
              or update data from an external server, including loading and
              error state.
            </li>

            <li>
              <span className="font-bold text-xl">URL state</span> – Data that
              exists on our URLs, including the pathname and query parameters.
              URL state is often missing as a category of state, but it is an
              important one. In many cases, a lot of major parts of our
              application rely upon accessing URL state.

            3 How does prototypical inheritance work
          </h1>
          <p className=" text-2xl">
            JavaScript is a bit confusing for developers experienced in
            class-based languages (like Java or C++), as it is dynamic and does
            not provide a class implementation per se (the class keyword is
            introduced in ES2015, but is syntactical sugar, JavaScript remains
            prototype-based).
            <br />
            When it comes to inheritance, JavaScript only has one construct:
            objects. Each object has a private property which holds a link to
            another object called its prototype. That prototype object has a
            prototype of its own, and so on until an object is reached with null
            as its prototype. By definition, null has no prototype, and acts as
            the final link in this prototype chain.
            <br />
            Nearly all objects in JavaScript are instances of Object, which has
            null as its prototype.

            4. Why you do not set the state directly in React. For example, if
            you have const [products, setProducts] = useState([]). Why you do
            not set products = [...] instead, you use the setProducts
          </p>
          <div className="">
            <p className="text-2xl py-5">
              One should never update the state directly because of the
              following reasons: If you update it directly, calling the
              setState() afterward may just replace the update you made. When
              you directly update the state, it does not change this.state
              immediately. Instead, it creates a pending state transition, and
              accessing it after calling this method will only return the
              present value. You will lose control of the state across all
              components. You should know how to work with class-based
              components as well as functional components, including hooks.
              Instead of directly learning functional components with React
              hooks, you should first understand class-based components so it's
              easy to clear the basics. You can call useState hook as many times
              as you like to use as many variables as you need. In the example
              given below…we have a basic form with email and password input. We
              are going to manage the state for each one of them as individual
              state variables.

            Unit testing, a testing technique using which individual modules are
            tested to determine if there are any issues by the developer

            standalone modules. The main aim is to isolate each unit of the
            system to identify, analyze and fix the defects.
